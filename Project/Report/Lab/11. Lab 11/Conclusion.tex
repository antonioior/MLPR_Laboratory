Concluding our experiment, it can be observed that quadratic models perform better.
Furthermore, among these models, it can be seen that those that make assumptions about the independence of the features don't lose performance,
which means that the features are indeed not particularly correlated, and this is also confirmed by the GMM model, the best performing,
that the features can be considered independent of each other.
